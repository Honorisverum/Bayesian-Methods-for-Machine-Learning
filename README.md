Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning
As part of this Coursera spetialization we implemented different algorithms like:
* Expectation maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
* Applied Variational Inference in a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture using Convolutional Networks
* Implemented a basic Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate probabilities and used MCMC to perform inference using PyMC3
* Performed regression tasks and hyperparameters optimization using Gaussian Processes.

All the assignments were done in Ipython notebooks.
